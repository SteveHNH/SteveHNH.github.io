            <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted anything to this blog in a really long time. A lot in life has changed, but I&rsquo;m not really going to concern myself with too much of it. Here are the high points:</p>
<pre><code>  * I'm now working at Red Hat. (Yay!)
  * Sam is 16 months old.
  * I finally pulled up all the ivy in my yard.
  * I'm learning to code with python and being somewhat successful with it.
</code></pre>
<p>Good! Now that we have all of that out of the way, it&rsquo;s time to cover the real subject of today&rsquo;s blog. Stephanie broke her kneecap.</p>
<p>You read that right. She broke her knee cap right in half. It may have been the most terrifying event of the year, and I have a sixteen month old that scares me nearly every day.</p>
<p>The day started normal enough. I kissed my beautiful wife and son goodbye and headed off to work in downtown Raleigh. Speaking of, it&rsquo;s only twenty minutes away from me which is amazing. I got a call about an hour after I got the office with Stephanie on the other end. It wasn&rsquo;t a cheerful or happy call that you would want to receive. It was that terrifying call that you never want to get as a husband. She was on the verge of tears and quickly told me, &ldquo;I need help. I think I broke my knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then. Holy crap.</p>
<p>I booked it home faster than I think I&rsquo;ve ever gone. I broke all the speed limits I could break as long as the cars in front of me would allow. I wouldn&rsquo;t advise this. I learned along the way that you can easily get a stress ulcer from trying desperately to spot all the police that might be on your path. Just don&rsquo;t do it. I don&rsquo;t know how people drive that way all the time and call it fun. It was awful. Maybe it was also crappy because I knew my wife was in the middle of the woods with my son and a broken knee.</p>
<p>Stephanie is tough as nails. I would have passed out if I had a knee cap that was broken in half, especially when it was so easy to tell what had happened. I got to her and found her and Sam watching cartoons on her phone. I have to hand it to the little guy. He was really good for a kid that had no idea what was going on and was sitting in the woods for nearly forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Stephanie&rsquo;s parents arrived about ten minutes after I did and we all worked together to hand out some tasks. I called 911, which was great because it gave me something to do. Doc check on her leg, and Stephanie&rsquo;s mom took care of Sam for us. Ashley also helped bring some levity to the whole situation, which she&rsquo;s awesome at. I had an awesome conversation with the 911 dispatcher and before we knew it, we had a ride to the hospital.</p>
<p>I had never ridden in an ambulance before. It wasn&rsquo;t much different than riding in the cab of a U-Haul, but there were more needles, lights, and seats. The two EMTs that helped Stephanie were amazing and super helpful. I wish we didn&rsquo;t need the ambulance, but there was no way of getting her out of there with her leg in the shape it was in. We could build a splint, but we had no way of getting some wheels.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent finding out that she had a broken patella and would likely need surgery to correct the damage. The weird part about all these shenanigans is that they won&rsquo;t even see her at the orthopedist until Tuesday. How can you walk around with a broken patella for nearly a week? That just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I guess they know more about knees than I do though, so we&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Stephanie&rsquo;s spirits have been really high and I hope we can both stay that way. Not being able to walk is a super bummer. We have an amazing support system from everywhere though, and even though taking care of her and Sam will be a challenge, I think we can pull it off. I just hope these next couple months go by quickly so she can get back to doing normal things.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to all the well wishers today. It was a challenging and long day, but I&rsquo;m glad we had wonderful people around to help us get through it. I&rsquo;m also incredibly grateful to my boss at Red Hat for being understanding. I&rsquo;ve only been there for three weeks and have already had to take time for a couple things that were out of my control. I like this job and definitely want to keep it!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to healing fast. Later!</p>
