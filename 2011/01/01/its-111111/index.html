            <p>This is my first post of the new year, 2011. It&rsquo;s a whole lot like the last post I had from 2010, in that it contains text. Many changes are in store, I can tell already.</p>
<p>I have to say that last night&rsquo;s Dick Clark&rsquo;s Rockin' Eve was a little weird. Why did they have the Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block come to perform? They weren&rsquo;t even popular this DECADE, much less this year. I guess NKOTB were popular, but only because they went on tour and moms (who were once kids in 1990) went to see them. If you put it that way, then I guess it makes sense.</p>

</a>I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot today but eat some good food and read an AMAZING comic book. My parents got me &ldquo;Superman: Earth One&rdquo; for Christmas, and it is probably one of the BEST Superman origin stories that I&rsquo;ve ever read or heard. There is so much heart in this book. It really deals with Clark Kent&rsquo;s reluctance to use his powers or to demonstrate his abilities at all. One of the most interesting things is that his parents were pushing him to not hold back, and to use his powers and be who he is. He&rsquo;s the one with the reservations about whether he wants to do that or not. It really focuses on the struggle that Clark has on whether to sacrifice a possible &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life by showing who he is to the world. He, of course, realizes that Earth needs him to be it&rsquo;s hero.</p>
<p>One of the COOLEST parts of this book was his mother&rsquo;s explanation of why he doesn&rsquo;t need to wear a mask. <em>SPOILER ALERT</em> She basically tells him that the people of Earth will be afraid of his abilities from the start. She says that the world needs to see the honesty, generosity, and caring in his eyes and face in order to trust him. &ldquo;The mask is what you will have to wear the rest of the time.&rdquo; I thought that that was such an awesome way of explaining why Superman chooses to wear glasses and mess with his hair to disguise himself, rather than the other way around like Batman, the Green Lantern, or any other masked hero. Every Superman fan should really check this story out. I loved it.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sitting in Stephanie&rsquo;s room at her parents' house thinking about going to bed. She&rsquo;s packing for her next rotation in Huntington and I&rsquo;m headed back to MoTown tomorrow. I finally pulled the trigger and got my World of Warcraft account back. I&rsquo;m really excited about it, because it is such an awesome game and I can&rsquo;t wait to play with my friends again. I was never really obsessed or addicted the first time I logged on and I don&rsquo;t plan on getting that way now. It&rsquo;s just a fun game to play when you have some downtime. An addict would say that, wouldn&rsquo;t he? :P</p>
<p>Have a great year everybody!</p>
