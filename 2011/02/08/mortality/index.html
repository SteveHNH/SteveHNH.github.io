</a>Growing up I&rsquo;ve never really had a whole lot of issues with anything as far as health is concerned. I&rsquo;ve always been pretty thin, spent very little time going to see doctors, never really had to go on any medication for anything major, and I&rsquo;ve always considered myself pretty much healthy. I guess you could say that I have pretty good genes&hellip;kind of. There is one thing that has managed to raise its ugly head at this point in my life: <strong>The Adams Curse</strong>. It&rsquo;s a particularly horrendous curse that just about every Adams is infected with and there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot we can do about it. We have a gremlin, passed down through generations, that crawls around in your bloodstream rubbing peanut butter on the walls of your arteries. He&rsquo;s an evil little devil who can only be vanquished by a little pill named Lipitor. Yep! I have <em>familial hypercholesterolemia</em>.</p>
<p>Familial Hypercholesterolemia is defined by Wikipedia as &ldquo;a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder">genetic disorder</a> characterized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia">high cholesterol levels</a>, specifically very high levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein">low-density lipoprotein</a> (LDL, &ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo;), in the blood&hellip;&rdquo; It&rsquo;s defined by me as &ldquo;a whole lot of suck.&rdquo; Yeah, it&rsquo;s no fun and probably means I&rsquo;ll be taking medication until I die to keep it under control. You could say that I&rsquo;m being a bit dramatic about the whole thing and it really isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal, but I&rsquo;ve never had to go on meds for anything for a long period of time. I&rsquo;ve been convinced for the last 25 years that I didn&rsquo;t have any of the major issues that my dad has. I&rsquo;ve been plagued by a few things, but they&rsquo;re manageable and don&rsquo;t require pills. Last night, I found out that this is a big deal and I have to limit my intake of some of my favorite foods! Disaster!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/heart.gif"><img src="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/heart-150x150.gif" alt="">
</a>That&rsquo;s not to say that I don&rsquo;t need to cut back on certain things anyway. The sad part is that because of my high cholesterol, I got denied life insurance from the company I was getting it from. They did the blood test and apparently I&rsquo;m a high risk candidate. Crazy talk, I say! I&rsquo;m 25! It&rsquo;s kind of weird though that I&rsquo;m not even that concerned over the life insurance thing. I was just getting that because it was cheap and available. I just thank God that I was able to learn about my cardiovascular issues early on. I don&rsquo;t know when I would be getting a blood test had it not been for this life insurance deal. It might have been another 10 years before I bothered with blood work.</p>
<p>I am incredibly thankful that this is something that I&rsquo;ll be able to handle without too much trouble. A few changes in diet, a pill to take every day, and exercise and I should be good to go. I already like to run and I don&rsquo;t eat terribly either so I really can&rsquo;t do much to fix it on my own. The bad thing about familial hypercholesterolemia is that you can&rsquo;t really do anything about it with just diet and exercise. So I get to officially go on medication at some point in the near future. I&rsquo;m not really too thrilled about that, but one must do what one must do I guess.</p>
<p>So here I am for the first time being faced with my own mortality. I only know one way to handle this&hellip;punch mortality right in the face! BOOM!</p>
