            <p>I learned in the last week that my best friend in the world is moving 3000 miles away to Seattle, WA. I&rsquo;ve never been on this side of the aisle before. I&rsquo;ve always been the one who decides to move away from everything he knows and venture off into the world. This is a completely different view of how that whole process works. I&rsquo;m always bothered by having to leave a place because of all the friends that I move away from, but I&rsquo;m also sort of uplifted about the adventure I&rsquo;m about to go on and who I might meet. This whole situation is completely backwards for me and I&rsquo;m having issues dealing with it.</p>
<p>I came to a conclusion about myself this past weekend when Steph and I were having a pretty deep conversation about life over an appetizer at Garfield&rsquo;s. Every time I lose a friend to distance (both figurative and literal) I honestly lose a bit of myself. I invest so much of what I have into my relationships with people that I&rsquo;m completely unsure what to do with myself when they leave. I&rsquo;m not sure where all this comes from, but I feel like whenever I have a special thing with someone else that I&rsquo;ll never be able to find someone else like them. Which has been pretty accurate so far.</p>
<p>Take Lando for instance. He&rsquo;s moving to Seattle. When he leaves, I will have lost one of the wittiest people I&rsquo;ve ever met and somebody I can confide in more than anyone (other than Steph of course.) He&rsquo;s the only other friend I have that I can sit around and quote &ldquo;The Big Lebowski&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pulp Fiction&rdquo; with and laugh endlessly. He&rsquo;s the only person that would even think to watch &ldquo;Black Dynamite&rdquo; with me and we nearly died laughing. We discuss Star Wars to no end and he deals with my constant re-tellings of stories he&rsquo;s heard a hundred times. Not to mention he also got me to start running and exercising even though I&rsquo;m one of the most difficult people he&rsquo;s probably ever dealt with in that respect. We invented &ldquo;Porching&rdquo; together along with our friend, Dave, and I&rsquo;m not sure how all that&rsquo;s going to work once he&rsquo;s gone. Ugh&hellip;this sucks. Who is going to help fill the gap that he&rsquo;s leaving behind? I know he&rsquo;s only a Skype call away, but that&rsquo;s a whole lot different than being right next door.</p>
<p>I remember when my good buddy Patrick and I split ways. I thought I would move to Florida and keep playing guitar, and keep learning everything I could about music. That stopped all but completely when I ended up in the middle of nowhere in Tallahassee. Even when I did meet some awesome people, I never got the spark for music back. I lost something I thought would always be there and now my electric guitar gathers dust most of the time. I used to poor so much of my soul into writing music and lyrics to play with Patrick. With him not in my life as much, I don&rsquo;t play much at all. I strum a few things and write a lick here and there, but nothing that will ever develop into a whole song that I can play and sing with friends. That part of me is just gone and I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll ever find someone to help pull it out again.</p>
<p>This list could go on and on with people who had a huge influence on me. My buddy Tony and I used to get together with a group of guys and play D&amp;D on Saturdays. I haven&rsquo;t played D&amp;D since we hung out together a few years ago. Yet another thing I just can&rsquo;t seem to get back. Without Ashley, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t podcast. And, let&rsquo;s face it, without Steph I might have trouble even finding a purpose for breathing.</p>
<p>This seems to have become a depressing post, and I&rsquo;m not depressed. I&rsquo;m just bummed and feeling a little introspective. I&rsquo;ve been involved in so much awesome stuff and gathered so many cool skills and hobbies from the people I&rsquo;ve been around, but it&rsquo;s like without them I can&rsquo;t seem to keep any of it going.</p>
<p>I hope this post hasn&rsquo;t belittled anybody or made them feel like they weren&rsquo;t a catalyst to something I got into. Everybody I know has left a huge impact on me in a ton of different ways. These are just people who were so instrumental in something for so long that I don&rsquo;t really know how to keep doing stuff without them. Who knows?! Maybe I&rsquo;ll pull myself back together and just keep moving forward. I guess I should probably just focus on the stuff that I&rsquo;m learning from new people rather than looking back at all the things I used to do.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s late and I probably shoot hit the hay. Good talk, blog.</p>
<p>Later :)</p>
