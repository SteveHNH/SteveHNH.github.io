            <p>I had this crazy prophetic dream last night. You know those dreams where you&rsquo;re in the future and you get to see all the things that <em>might</em> happen to you. Well, mine was pretty cool and everything looked alright.</p>
<p>I went to this building where they had a time machine that kind of looked like a doorway with a purple &ldquo;stargate-ish&rdquo; watery thing inside it. I walked through and it transported me 5 years into the future. I walked out of the building and somehow found my car which had either North Carolina license plate, or a Florida one. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell, but it was cool. I still had my Scion tC and it looked really good, minus the scratches on the back. Evidently I&rsquo;m never going to get that fixed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what happened after finding my car, but I wound up in the basement of my future house. Chris was there and I told him that I had to keep my eyes shut and hide so I wouldn&rsquo;t see my future self. I was telling him that I didn&rsquo;t want to rip a hole in the space/time continuum and screw up everything. Chris insisted that I just go talk to myself, which I relunctantly did. I looked pretty much the same, but I was 27&hellip;which is scary to start with. I also met Stephanie and she was smokin' hot as always <img src="http://www.piandchips.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)">
. She did have shorter hair, it was about down to her shoulders and straight.</p>
<p>After talking for a while, I learned that we were married and had been for 3 years. So from this, I gather that I will be married to Stephanie in 2 years <img src="http://www.piandchips.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)">
. Anyway, I also asked the all important question, &ldquo;Did you guys <em>wait</em>?&rdquo; To which they answered &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then I asked them if it was worth it, to which they also answered &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; So this solidifies the fact that I wll be a virgin for the next 2 years <img src="http://www.piandchips.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)">
. Also not a big deal, I just wanted to know haha. I got to see our future dog, who was either a dachsund or a Yorkie&hellip;the details are fuzzy.</p>
<p>After having dinner with the future &ldquo;us&rdquo;, I went to see my mom. She told me that my podcast was huge and I was really successful. Apparently Steph was doing well also, because we had a really big house. It was 3 stories and was really nice. After that I had to leave and I woke up to the sound of my alarm. Crazy Stuff!</p>
<p>This dream was really detailed, and I really hope stuff turns out as well as it did in my dream. I guess we&rsquo;ll see in 5 years <img src="http://www.piandchips.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>
<p>Do you guys ever have dreams like this? If so, what were they about?</p>
