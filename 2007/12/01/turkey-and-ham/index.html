            <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed an entire month of blogging :(. That totally throws off my archive list, and now it&rsquo;s missing the month of November &lsquo;07! What am I going to think someday when I look back at this blog and see an entire month missing? I&rsquo;ll probably just assume that I was too busy to blog, which is totally not the case! I had plenty of time to get on here and write a few things, ANYTHING, but I just didn&rsquo;t have the drive. I guess I just haven&rsquo;t been in the writing mood, but here I am now, on December 1st, writing in the blog about stuff.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving was awesome! I got to go to WV so that I could have Thanksgiving with Stephanie and her family and we had a blast. I can&rsquo;t wait til I finally find a job up there and can be with her on a permanent basis. I&rsquo;ve had enough of this crap. Anyway, we had an amazing Thanksgiving dinner thanks to her dad&rsquo;s skills with the turkey and the multiple cooks in the kitchen making some of the best food I&rsquo;ve had in a while. I made a key lime pie for desert and I&rsquo;m pretty sure everybody enjoyed it. It&rsquo;s a really easy recipe and takes no time at all to make. I also learned that it is much better with fresh squeezed limes as opposed to lime juice in a bottle :).</p>
<p>When I got back from my oh so excellent trip, Chris and I had Rock Band sitting in a box waiting for us. I have to say that I really love this game. I definitely love the drum peripheral, and the guitar looks much more like a guitar than any of the Guitar Hero versions. I can see this being one of those games that you should only pick up if you have a few friends who are as into it as you are. The solo part of the game really isn&rsquo;t all that fun. To be honest, the multiplayer is only fun because you are with more people.  You end up having to play the same songs over and over 1000 times before you can actually get new ones and get anywhere. There is even a few &ldquo;Marathons&rdquo; where you play 10 songs or more in a row and have to beat them all to win. Needless to say, your drummer can get exhausted. Character creation is incredible though and you can tell that Harmonix took a great deal of time to make this one of the best rhythm based games on the markert.</p>
<p>In other Stephen news, I have taken upon myself the task of becoming a Ham Radio operator. I&rsquo;ve thought about it a few times in the past but never really pursued the idea until recently. I was reading on <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com">How Stuff Works</a>, which is one of the best sites EVER, and thought that this could be a really cool hobby. I&rsquo;ve never done anything radio wise, but I know people who do and they have  a blast with it. Plus, I figure with the zombie apocalypse breathing down our necks all the time, I might need to have some backup communication! So I&rsquo;m reading the Ham Radio License Manual right now and looking forward to a free class at the Red Cross in January. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with it all once I get my license, but there are probably plenty of people out there that I would really enjoy talking to. I&rsquo;m trying to get my friends from WV in on it so we might be able to talk over it at some point. It should be fun!</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s all I really have for now. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be back in less than a month to update you on things :). I know you are all on the edge of your seat at all times waiting to hear what goes on in the wide world of Stephen ;P. Later guys! Stay cool!</p>
