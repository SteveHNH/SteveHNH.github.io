            <p>Man, it has been way too long since I&rsquo;ve written. I think I&rsquo;m going to just go ahead and start every post like that. I might as well make it official since that&rsquo;s pretty much what I&rsquo;ve been doing ever time I&rsquo;ve written for the past few months. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have the time to do it, it&rsquo;s just that I really don&rsquo;t know what to say. But I think I have a handful of things I can actually talk about this time around.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the BIG one: I&rsquo;ve been heavily thinking about moving back to West Virginia. It&rsquo;s not an easy decision to come to, especially since I don&rsquo;t have a job up there yet, but it&rsquo;s something that I think I have to do. Stephanie and I have lived apart from each other for 5 years now, and that&rsquo;s just too long for somebody to have to do this. I want to be able to stop missing her all the time, and for us both to be able to share in the simple things that we&rsquo;ve missed out on. I can&rsquo;t even call her up and see if she wants to go grocery shopping with me. She&rsquo;s 900 miles away!</p>
<p>This hasn&rsquo;t been an easy decision to come to at all. I don&rsquo;t want to leave all of my friends or my very stable job, but sometimes hard decisions have to be made. I&rsquo;ve prayed and prayed and prayed about this, and I feel a peace about it. I couldn&rsquo;t explain it to anybody, because what I want to do is completely illogical and any sane person wouldn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m leaving a very well paying job, the most awesome people I&rsquo;ve ever met, and my parents, but I feel that this is what I need to do. Stephanie is all that is important in my life, and I don&rsquo;t want to be away from her anymore. That&rsquo;s understandable right?</p>
<p>I know I can get a job in Morgantown, but I can&rsquo;t do that from here. So I will be moving up there and then seeking out a good IT job in hopes that I can support myself. And if I&rsquo;m lucky, I&rsquo;ll be able to support her too so we can finally get married. I&rsquo;m honestly overwhelmed with happiness whenever I think about being close to her for more than a week. I&rsquo;m pretty sure whenever this distance thing is finally over that I&rsquo;ll just collapse into a heap of tears with her because we&rsquo;ve gone through so much doing this. It&rsquo;s going to take me weeks just to get used to it. I love her so much.</p>
<p>There is really so much I look forward to in moving up there. I can make Horseshoes &amp; Hand Grenades a better show because me and Ash won&rsquo;t have to use Skype anymore. The quality can improve, and we can start work on our book. It&rsquo;s so hard to collaborate from so far away. I think this is going to turn both me and Stephanie&rsquo;s worlds upside-down, but I think that&rsquo;s what we need. We&rsquo;re so used to not having to struggle for anything, but I think that going through this will make us better people and more prepared for the curveballs life can throw.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect anybody who knows me to really feel what I do about this. It&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t explain, and something that nobody who isn&rsquo;t in the situation can ever feel. It&rsquo;s just love. It&rsquo;s an unexplainable thing that you can never understand until you actually have it yourself. Steph and I are a team, back to back against everything that comes at us. We look at the world with the idea that in the end, the only person we&rsquo;ll have to lean on is each other. She&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll ever need to be happy, regardless of whatever situation we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s just an update on what&rsquo;s been going on in my mind lately. I&rsquo;ve been doing most of my blogging on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stevehnh">Twitter</a> which is half the reason I haven&rsquo;t posted many long things on this blog. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get better at it. Once I get rolling on my moving plan I&rsquo;ll post a little bit to let you guys know how it&rsquo;s all going. Wish me luck!!</p>
