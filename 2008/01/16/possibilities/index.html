            <p>I really need to put a stop to this once a month posting crap that I&rsquo;m doing. I wish that I was always in the mood to write something about myself or stuff around me, but I&rsquo;m just not. I used to not have that many people to talk to about stuff, especially stuff that I&rsquo;m interested in, but now I have a ton of friends that actually care. So usually I&rsquo;m getting all the stuff I want to say off my chest at work, but I really do need to blog more. I keep going back to read old posts and they are really enjoyable. I&rsquo;m going to work on this. I thought it was going to be an easy New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to keep but it&rsquo;s just not. Anyway, here&rsquo;s an update on my life.</p>
<p>I had an interview with a company in Morgantown, WV today. If you&rsquo;ve been keeping up with the goings on in my life for the past year, you&rsquo;d know that Stephanie, my beautiful fiance, is going to school in Morgantown at WVU. This is an awesome opportunity for us to get back in the same state and most of all SET A WEDDING DATE! We have been praying for something like this for so long! I don&rsquo;t eve know what I&rsquo;m going to feel like if I get the job. I can&rsquo;t even imagine the slew of emotions that I&rsquo;ll feel. I&rsquo;m trying not to get too excited because the last time I got excited over a job, it didn&rsquo;t quite work out and I was still living in Florida. I really need this, and so does she. Maybe everything will work out and I&rsquo;ll land the job and be able to move up there.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about it is that I won&rsquo;t ever have to tell Stephanie good-bye anymore. I won&rsquo;t have to watch her get on a plane and fly out of my life for another two months. I can call her up anytime I want and say, &ldquo;Hey, Stephanie! Do you want to go to a movie or something?&rdquo; Or even just ask her if she wants to come over and sit around. I&rsquo;ve never had that with her and its an incredible thought to me. I&rsquo;m so in love with this girl that it&rsquo;s crazy, and the idea of getting a job and finally being with her is kind of overwhelming. I&rsquo;m so excited though and I hope this all works out so bad. The guy at the place seemed really optomistic to me and seemed like he really wants to get with me and actually have a face to face meeting. I told him that I definitely want to come up there and meet him face to face as well. I know I can do the job that they are wanting me to do, and I have no doubt that I could also do it well.</p>
<p>My only hope is that the General Manager of the place actually likes my resume enough and wants to meet with me as well. They sounded positive and we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the only big thing that has happened to me lately, so I&rsquo;ll just leave it at this. I&rsquo;m just glad that I finally wrote something :) . By the way, the Macbook Air looks awesome! Later guys</p>
