            <p>Hey everybody! My name is Stephen and I fail miserably at keeping this blog going for long periods of time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/washington-monument.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/washington-monument-150x150.jpg" alt="">
</a>I took a trip this past weekend up to one of the COOLEST places that I have ever been, and that is Washington D.C. I&rsquo;ve often wondered how this amazing place could not be in a state. It&rsquo;s part of the United States of America, so shouldn&rsquo;t belong somewhere in the states? No! Washington D.C. is it&rsquo;s own little place where the federal government sits. I asked my mom when I was small what state Washington DC was in, and she told me simply, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in a state.&rdquo; My perplexed little brain just couldn&rsquo;t wrap around this fact so again I insisted, &ldquo;Well, is it in Maryland?&rdquo; To which she replied, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just the District of Columbia.&rdquo; Do what? What is that supposed to mean? Is it in Maryland or Virginia? I was so confused. I&rsquo;m not as confused anymore because I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s the seat of the federal government. It can&rsquo;t be in a state or it would be required to abide by state laws, which it doesn&rsquo;t. One thing I can ask is, why is there housing there? Where do they fall?</p>
<p>Anyway, none of that is what I actually wanted to talk about. I believe that EVERY American citizen should venture to our nation&rsquo;s capital at some point in their lives. I was instilled with a sense of patriotism that I just don&rsquo;t carry around on a daily basis. Between the memorials, monuments, and craptons of historical places, I was enthralled with our country. You actually get to see the history of the place we live and gain a respect for all the people who came together to make it what it is. The Vietnam Memorial wall was one of the most sobering sights that I have ever seen. There are SO many names of people lost during that war, and you just can&rsquo;t understand it until you&rsquo;ve seen it laid out like that. It really is unbelievable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lincoln_memorial_02.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lincoln_memorial_02-150x150.jpg" alt="">
</a>Seeing pictures of these places and watching videos will never do it the justice it deserves. I&rsquo;ve seen Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s memorial I don&rsquo;t know how many times, but it was ten times more amazing that I ever though it would be. This is a guy who pretty much held together our country when it was at it&rsquo;s lowest point, and you feel that when you are in that memorial. It&rsquo;s not something you walk up to and just nonchalantly look at and walk away form. I stood there and was completely amazed by what I was seeing. Whoever carved this thing was an amazing artist and took great pains to capture every detail. There are also a couple of Abe&rsquo;s most famous speeches carved into the wall. It truly is an incredible site.</p>
<p>Everything in DC is so HUGE. I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of pictures of the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, and everything else, but those pictures cannot capture the size. These buildings are massive, and it&rsquo;s truly a sight to see. So, long story short, you should go visit as soon as you can. One thing I would advise is to stop OUTSIDE the city and ride the Metro in. That subway is the easiest thing to understand and I would take full advantage of it if you can. My feet are still killing me from walking for those 3 days, but it was worth every minute. Go see it!</p>
