            <p>Today has been a whole lot less eventful than I expected. I woke up early and, in between bouts of installing Windows 7, cleaned up the house in an attempt to make it look nice for Steph&rsquo;s family when they arrived. I cleaned the sink, picked up clutter, took out trash, and made the whole place look a little better than it did. Not that there was a whole lot to do because I tend to keep things OCD clean anyway. Unless you count my desk&hellip;that thing is a mess. Anyway, I went through all of this preparation and, lo and behold, the &ldquo;Winter Powerhouse&rdquo; found it&rsquo;s way to the Northeast US and decided to CRUSH Morgantown in it&rsquo;s icy grip. This, unfortunately, meant no Steph&rsquo;s family and no trip to Pittsburgh. Oh well! I guess we&rsquo;ll have to plan for sometime in the middle of the week because, by golly, these brides maid dresses aren&rsquo;t going to buy themselves!</p>
<p>It ended up being a Â good thing that they didn&rsquo;t come up though. This storm is nuts! I&rsquo;m talking crazy amounts of that fluffy stuff is falling from the sky and straight into my little corner of the planet. I swear we got 1/4 inch in about 5 minutes. It&rsquo;s accumulating like crazy. Watching people trying to get up the hill across the way in their little cars is really suspenseful. So many people are running into each other it&rsquo;s like watching a giant bumper car round out there. Except when these cars hit, they have to call the police. Blue lights everywhere!</p>

</a>Steph and I did manage to accomplish a little bit in that we got our &ldquo;accommodations&rdquo; cards printed to go with our Save the Date cards. These Save the Date cards turned out really well and I&rsquo;m all excited about it. They are actually magnets that you can stick to the refrigerator so you can be reminded of the joyous event of which you will take part. The picture we took for it didn&rsquo;t turn out half bad either. Granted it was snowing out and we were freezing to death. I think it&rsquo;s pretty hard to tell that my teeth are chattering all over the place though. We did a good job masking the 5 degree shivers. Every time I see that picture I&rsquo;m going to think about that now. That&rsquo;s why I love looking at old pictures. They always bring back some crazy memories. I wonder how people remembered their lives before we had all this media. I guess they just told stories all the time, but I tell stories a lot and don&rsquo;t remember some things until I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures that are related to them. Something to think about I guess.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is get our envelopes printed with all the addresses for the people receiving cards and we&rsquo;ll be in business. We tried to do them on the inkjet, but the envelopes are too short and go crooked when you feed them through. I&rsquo;m hoping that a print shop around here can do it so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. One more thing to add to the list I suppose.</p>
