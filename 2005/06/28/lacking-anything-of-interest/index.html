            <p>Nothing at all interesting has been happening these past few days. I would be posting more but now that <a href="http://steveandlando.blogspot.com">the podcast</a> is going strong, it&rsquo;s hard decide what to post about and what to podcast about. I really would like to talk about everything but I&rsquo;m saving everything that is really cool for the podcast. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll talk about the good stuff that nobody really cares about on here&hellip;AKA: My Life. Ha! That&rsquo;s what blogs are for anyway.</p>
<p>I just started my security classes at school. When I say security, I mean cyber security, not rent-a-cop style security. I never plan to wear a badge, unless it&rsquo;s one of those that you get for working in the government that gets you into top secret places. Man, that would be awesome. These classes are really awesome though. We&rsquo;re learning so much stuff about security that it&rsquo;s kind of making me paranoid. The only thing about it is that we can&rsquo;t install any programs on our computers unless we use it for class. This hindered me greatly from getting the podcast on the internet so it was a bit late. My project this week is to get music for <a href="http://steveandlando.blogspot.com">the podcast</a> so you guys don&rsquo;t have to hear us talk about Peter John Ross on every episode so we don&rsquo;t get sued.</p>
<p>Anyway, not much else has been going on. I got a 98 in speech, which I think is pretty impressive considering that I didn&rsquo;t start one speech until the night before, and did one of them right before class. I got a great grade on it too. I guess I just knew what I was talking about so it was wicked easy to get a good grade. My teacher said I was very animated, which I guess is a compliment but I&rsquo;m not completely sure. At least I got a good great! Woohoo!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix for the second time. I want to be all prepared for the next book that comes out. I love Harry Potter man. When I read the first book it really reminded me of Roald Dahl&rsquo;s writing style. His books were awesome. It&rsquo;s basically the same as James and the Giant Peach: Kid has cruel adoptive parents then finds happiness in a magical world. That&rsquo;s the way they are..but it works! The cool thing about Harry Potter is, the book is for everybody. I find myself HATING some of these characters because they are about as mean as you can think, then others you just love. It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess thats about it for today. I&rsquo;m going to test out <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 4.9</a> now. It has Podcasting Support. I want to know what it takes to get listed in their library ;) . I am, of course, only going to install it on my Mac because I use <a href="http://www.winamp.com">WinAmp</a> on my PC because it&rsquo;s way less of a memory hog. Rock on!</p>
