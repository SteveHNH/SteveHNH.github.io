<p>I missed writing in my blog yesterday and now my Seinfeldian Chain has a gaping hole in it that will never be filled :(. I&rsquo;m pretty bummed out about this and was incredibly pbothered when I woke up and realized that I hadn&rsquo;t done the one task that I set out to do everyday. My OCD can&rsquo;t handle these types of things. My mind started racing with ways that I can fix it, but I kept running into the problem of not being able to turn back the clock. Unfortunately, time is a thing that you can&rsquo;t get back once it goes by. All I can do from here is try to make sure I don&rsquo;t screw it up again &gt;_&lt;. So we&rsquo;ll just start fresh from today and try this again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Steph and I had an incredible date day today. We actually spent a ton of time at Bond Park, the park up the road, and just enjoyed being together. We went on a walk around one of the trails and it ended up bringing us back to where we started but we were at the top of an awesome hill where a ton of kids were playing. You basically overlook a huge open field from on top of this hill, so we just found a bench and sat together talking for a while. It&rsquo;s amazing what the world can be like when you are just sitting around free from distractions. We had great conversation and watched all the people spending time together.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s pretty awesome about doing this is that we just talked about coming together as a people at church today. Our pastor, Mike Lee, was encouraging us to spend time with people and come together in order to grow spiritually. He had a lot of awesome things to say and a bunch of great points. The average Facebook user has 314 &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think I even know 314 people. I read somewhere once that people can only truly sustain up to around 100 friendships before the quality of the relationships starts to suffer. I totally believe that&rsquo;s an accurate figure. I don&rsquo;t even know how you know that many people. I think I would rather have 10 awesome friends that I trust completely than have 314 random people who call themselves my friend. I may have 100 friends on my list, but half of them don&rsquo;t use Facebook anymore and the rest of them just have really cool things to say that I like to hear about. A lot of them are also friends I had in high school that I just like to keep up with and be able to say hi to every once in a while.</p>
<p>That was a pretty significant tangent for this blog, but it came to mind so I figured I would head off on that bunny trail. Steph and I are trying to do our couple&rsquo;s devotions again. We were really good there for a little while but we fell off the bandwagon for a bit. There are a lot of bandwagons we&rsquo;ve fallen off of Â here lately, but we&rsquo;re really going to try it over again. We just need to learn to quit quitting, and to get right back on the horse afterwards. We have a tendency to go for a time without thinking about stuff, then realize we&rsquo;re way off base. My todoist todo list is going to help a lot with it I think. I made it my homepage in Chrome so I get reminded of stuff every time I jump on the computer to do something. It&rsquo;s kind of helpful. I have a lot of things on it, but I&rsquo;m trying to get to everything as best I can. A lot of it is just things I&rsquo;d like to do, but don&rsquo;t have any real timeline for. We&rsquo;ll see how far we get.</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m all over the place with my thoughts tonight. I need to get it together with all my writing. I need to stop just dumping my whole brain into this and pick something and stick with it. Eh, this is for me anyway. I might enjoy reading it all someday :)</p>
