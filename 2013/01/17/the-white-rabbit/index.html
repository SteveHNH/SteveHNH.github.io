            <p>I was so stupid late for work this morning. I woke up a full 30 minutes AFTER I should have been there. I woke up and noticed that it was a whole lot brighter in the room than it normally was&hellip;then it hit! The panic! I flipped out when I saw that it was 8:06. I normally wake up at 6:45. The good news is that my job doesn&rsquo;t really require me to have a set schedule and I don&rsquo;t HAVE to be there at the same time everyday. I made up for the time this afternoon so it was no big deal. I emailed my boss about it but he never responded, so I&rsquo;m going to guess that all is well. Still in my probationary period too &gt;_&lt;. Regardless of not having a real schedule, I still am disappointed in myself. I should have been there. Well, there is always tomorrow!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In other news, it&rsquo;s snowing outside! That&rsquo;s right! I left WV to get away from it, and it managed to  hit us here in NC. It&rsquo;s hilarious to hear the news and watch people freak out over it. It&rsquo;s supposed to snow about 2 inches, which is craziness for these poor people. It&rsquo;s like the end of the world is occuring. I have to say that I am a bit nervous about driving into work in the morning. I mean, I know how to drive in the snow and ice, but I&rsquo;m not too confident in the rest of the NC populous. Not to mention, they just don&rsquo;t have the equipment to treat the roads down here. This doesn&rsquo;t happen nearly enough for them to worry about it. SNOWMAGEDDON!</p>
<p>They actually told us that work  may be called off for tomorrow. Not in the way you would hope. They just don&rsquo;t want us to come in. You see, my job allows me to work remotely if necessary, so I still get to work, I just get to do it at home. Well, not really. I don&rsquo;t have the ability to badge in remotely thanks to not having an account wherever it is that I&rsquo;m supposed to be able to do that. So I guess I have to go in just so I can badge in and I might as well work. Let&rsquo;s just hope I can make it there tomorrow and not get into any trouble on the roads. I may just have to go in late again, which doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much. The traffic is crap at that time of the day though. Maybe I could wake up, do some work from home, then head in. That might be a possibility for me. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s already late and I don&rsquo;t have a whole lot going on at the moment. Going to be out of town on Saturday helping Ash with stuff, but I should be able to blog. Must not break the chain! I guess even if I get to write a paragraph for a minute that would be something. I&rsquo;ll count it. I&rsquo;ve started to wonder what all the different categories of post actually do. There are several that allow for short, sweet, posts of things. I might give one of those a shot if I feel really short on time. We&rsquo;ll see what happens!</p>
