            <p>I decided that this year I would try to spend a bit more time blogging about stuff, or just writing in general. So where better to start than on my blog on the first day of this brand new year. I don&rsquo;t think this is the first time I&rsquo;ve written this out or decided that I was going to write more often in the new year so take this resolution with a grain of salt. On top of writing, I&rsquo;ve also decided to eat better, get healthy, and just be an all around better person. I think I have a shot at the healthy part. Stephanie is working really hard and she&rsquo;s inspiring me a lot, so as long as we can keep each other accountable, we should be okay.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So far though, my new year has been full of a whole lot of nothing. I pretty much spent the whole day playing Assassin&rsquo;s Creed III and watching the bonus features from the Indiana Jones movies on Blu-ray. I have to say though, it was nice to just chill and not do anything. Steph and I together broke a couple traditions though. We were supposed to eat sauerkraut and black-eyed peas today so that we could have some good luck and what not. I don&rsquo;t much believe in luck, but it&rsquo;s still just a fun tradition to get into. The sauerkraut thing comes from Stephanie&rsquo;s side of the family. You put coins into the sauerkraut and whoever gets a coin when their eating will have good fortune for the new year. That&rsquo;s pretty fun. I guess the southern thing  (the black-eyed peas) is that whoever eats gets good luck. We just let everybody join in. Southern hospitality I suppose :).</p>
<p>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed III has totally redeemed the series for me, hence why I was playing it all day when I should have at least been doing something productive. I accomplished very little in the real world, but I&rsquo;m making sure those American rebels succeed in overthrowing the British rule and getting their own country. I really wish I knew more about American history. I&rsquo;m a total history buff, and the American Revolution is an era of history that I absolutely love. Even when I was a kid in my history classes, I always loved the story of how we became a country. I kind of wish I knew more about how the common man was back then. I feel like that would make it pop a lot more and seem relevant to the rest of us. These were real, living, breathing people. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine having to go through what they did during that time. A few of my ancestors did, and I&rsquo;m very proud to know that there are people in my family line that thought this country was worth fighting to gain. Anyway, I rambled for a second, but all that is just to say that this is a great game and I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful that I no longer have to listen to Italian people mix Italian words into English at random points.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one day down and 364 more to go this year. Man, I can&rsquo;t wait to get into this year and see what happens. I&rsquo;m sure it will come with it&rsquo;s fair share of struggles, but I&rsquo;m glad to just be breathing, have my amazing wife by my side, and do the things that I really enjoy. God has truly blessed my life in incredible ways. Woohoo!</p>
