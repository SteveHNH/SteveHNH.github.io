            <p>So I just went to see Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s latest film and I have to say this BLEW MY MIND. I had no idea what to expect to be honest, and a lot of the time I walk out of Tarantino flicks having to think about what I just saw. I don&rsquo;t have to think at all to see the awesomeness of Django. This movie had everything you could want: evil villains, great heroes, epic story, love, incredible characters, the works! I think that Christoph Waltz and Tarantino were born to make movies together. Waltz helps breathe so much life into the words on the page that it appears effortless. He did a remarkable job as Dr. King Schultz, bounty hunter. I could watch him read the phone book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This movie definitely had its share of gut punches throughout. Seeing the raw presentation of the most evil of slaveowners was pretty tough to see at times. At a point in history, these kinds of situations were real and Django Unchained doesn&rsquo;t forgive the acts of the past by watering them down. Quentin shows you each and every nasty part of the whole business, and it&rsquo;s really heartbreaking when you get right down to it. But, he doesn&rsquo;t let you stay heartbroken for long. This movie packs plenty of long belly laughs and, along with it, tons of blood. I have to say that I&rsquo;m incredibly glad I&rsquo;ve never seen a bullet hit someone, but I think it would probably be a lot less flashy than what Tarantino wanted to show. Blood goes EVERYWHERE! It&rsquo;s like people have little pocket grenades that go off whenever they get hit with a bullet. In all honesty, if it wasn&rsquo;t for it just being Tarantino&rsquo;s style, I would have called it distracting. There&rsquo;s a lot of blood, and it really doesn&rsquo;t add much.</p>
<p>There are tons of scenes that had me busting a gut though. Anytime Dr. Schultz is trying to explain his occupation after offing someone, you have to laugh or you aren&rsquo;t human. It&rsquo;s a ridiculous situation and this man weaves a tapestry of words that gets him right where he needs to be to safely walk away. I loved it! It was so incredibly enjoyable to watch. Jamie Foxx definitely holds his own as Django as well. He&rsquo;s a powerful presence and played such an amazing part. I know that Quentin had written the role for Will Smith, but I&rsquo;m so glad that he had to back out and let us have Jamie Foxx. He did an amazing job. Someone deserves an Oscar for this movie.</p>
<p>Well done, Mr. Tarantino! Now where&rsquo;s our 1930&rsquo;s gangster flick!?</p>
