            <p>I feel like I may die.</p>
<p>Okay, that was a bit dramatic, but I think it&rsquo;s accurate. I started back on P90X today in order to get myself back in shape. I can&rsquo;t seem to stick to anything, but I&rsquo;m giving this another go. Way back in 2012 I had actually been fairly consistent with doing exercise. I was really starting to gain some muscle and feel better about myself, but I fell off the wagon hard after about 2 months of doing it. That really bummed me out, and it&rsquo;s always hard to get back at it when that happens. Today was my first day back, and I already wish I had never quit. It&rsquo;s so hard on your body when you first start exercising. I thought I was going to throw up when I finished 0_0.Â <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>None of this is all that important though. What IS important is the first issue of &ldquo;The Superior Spider-Man&rdquo; launched this week and I got to read it. This is the first issue where we see how the ending of the 700 issue long &ldquo;The Amazing Spider-Man&rdquo; pans out for everyone, including Peter Parker. So, Doc Oc has officially taken over Peter Parker&rsquo;s body and is convinced that he is going to be a better hero than Parker ever dreamed of. Only we get to see that Doc Oc is not quite the hero he should be. Needless to say, this post will contain a few spoilers, so watch out below!</p>

</a>I am incredibly upset with this new Spider-Man. That&rsquo;s not to say that I&rsquo;m entertained by the story, because I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic risk that Dan Slott is taking in changing our favorite wall-crawler&rsquo;s entire personality. There could be a downright lynch mob following this guy around, but he did it anyway. So gone is the wise-cracking Spider-Man that we&rsquo;ve loved since the 1960&rsquo;s, and in his place is the logical, calculated, and somewhat angry Spider-Man. Doc Oc&rsquo;s personality bleeds through every bit of Spider-Man and you know good and well that this character can&rsquo;t last in this iteration. You just can&rsquo;t relate to the guy! He&rsquo;s too smart for us and he&rsquo;s too &hellip; evil, I guess. What else do you expect from one of Spidey&rsquo;s greatest villains? Instill all the memories of a good guy that you want, he&rsquo;s still who he is.</p>
<p>The great news is that apparently Peter Parker is still in that brain somewhere, and he&rsquo;s fighting his way back. He stays Oc&rsquo;s hand when he tries to kill one of Spidey&rsquo;s villains! It&rsquo;s kind of weird because you see this ghost Peter, but I don&rsquo;t really think they are going with a ghost type deal. I think Peter Parker is still in that brain, he&rsquo;s just been pushed to the back by all of Doctor Octopus' memories and thoughts. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the two just got copied to each other brains, but both are still in there somewhere. I&rsquo;m honestly super excited to see where this goes. I really want Peter back because we&rsquo;ve loved him for so long. I think this is a cool opportunity to still change the character a bit though, because once he fights his way out of the mental cage he is in, he&rsquo;ll still have all of Doctor Octopus' skills and memories. That&rsquo;s a pretty big deal. Hopefully he loses the aggression though. But it may make for some really awesome storylines in the future.</p>
<p>All in all, I would say good job on Spidey! Dan Slott has been writing him for a whole crapton of issues and it&rsquo;s been some of the most fun Spider-Man stories I&rsquo;ve read. I know he can keep it up, and won&rsquo;t disappoint all the fans :)</p>
