            <p>This weekend has been really good for me so far! I&rsquo;ve been able to do some pretty fun things and at least one &ldquo;first&rdquo; for me. On Friday, my new laptop came! I finally broke down and pulled the trigger on a new machine. I&rsquo;ve been without a laptop since probably October of last year. Thanks, mostly, to my thought that if I sold my laptop I would be able to quickly purchase a new one using the money I earned. I pulled in $300 for my old laptop and that didn&rsquo;t quite do it for me. We ended up needing to use that for other stuff and I was out my $300 savings. So I spent the next months planning my next purchase, much to the frustration of all of my friends. I finally managed to pull it off and come up with something that I could use and enjoy!</p>
<p>I picked up a 13&quot; Macbook Pro with Retina display! I got it off the Apple refurb store, and ended up saving me $230 over all. It&rsquo;s from late October so it&rsquo;s not even that old, which is great. They did just release some updates but it only really bumped the processor by 100Mhz, which really doesn&rsquo;t do that much for me anyway. It has 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. The SSD is really small, but after getting everything installed I still have 95GB of storage left over. Considering I don&rsquo;t download music off iTunes (Spotify) and I won&rsquo;t be using this for Photos so much (needs TONS of storage), I think it will do me for a while. I also have the option of upgrading the storage at some point since it isn&rsquo;t soldered on, so I can always do that in the future if I really get in a bind. The cloud has really helped out with this whole small storage thing. I also won&rsquo;t be using it for gaming. It&rsquo;s mostly going to be used at work and just to have something portable for blogging, doing work in the living room, and other types of things. I love it so far and I&rsquo;m pumped about it :)</p>
<p>I also got to go to a gun show this weekend! My father-in-law is really into guns and stuff so it was kind of cool to go with him. He ended up finding a guy who was selling the steel ammo cases for $12 a piece. That&rsquo;s a killer deal apparently. I think he bought four of them. I wandered around a bit just to see what gun shows were all about. There was a ton of stuff there. They had everything from revolvers, to assault weapons, to knives, to baseball cards. Not sure how the baseball cards belonged in there, but I guess people there were just collectors of things for the most part anyway. There was some really cool WWI and WWII stuff there too. I saw some gas masks, leather holsters, and other things that were really old.</p>
<p>All the people were really nice too. I ended up buying a few sticks of beef jerky that were delicious. Go figure I would go to a gun show and sniff out some delicious food. The guy was selling jalapeno beef jerky and he just mentioned it as I was walking by. It was delicious! It had just the right amount of heat to it. It didn&rsquo;t hurt but it made your tongue tingle a little bit. My brother-in-law, Stephen, and his son were also there and it was good hanging out with them too. Stevie, his son, is a really cool kid and he&rsquo;s got a lot of the same interests that I have. It&rsquo;s kind of nice to be able to nurture some of his hobbies and things so I can help him get into some cool stuff. He&rsquo;s really into linux right now so I&rsquo;m glad I have that experience to help him get into some things. I hope I&rsquo;m doing it all right 0_o</p>
<p>Well, I have to get up super early and go to the church in the morning to help put the stage together. I&rsquo;m really excited about it. It&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ll be helping out so I really hope that I can do a decent job and remember what to do. It&rsquo;s a little intimidating but I think I can pull it off. I&rsquo;m just going to dive in headfirst and do some stuff and hopefully it will all come together. Everybody is really nice so I&rsquo;m not too worried about. Hooray for doing something good!!</p>
