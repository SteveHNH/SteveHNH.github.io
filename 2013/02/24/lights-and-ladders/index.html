            <p>I got to wake up at the crack of dawn this morning to go help setup the church this morning and once again had a really good time. Everybody there is so nice, and they had plenty of things that needed done. I won&rsquo;t go too much into it other than I had a blast, met some cool people, talked to a few more folks, and I just hope that I can keep learning more stuff and get more involved.</p>
<p>I did learn one that that deserves to be talked about and that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;over/under&rdquo; cable wrapping method. Dave had mentioned this to me a few times, but I really had no idea what he was talking about. A guy at the church mentioned that the cables were over/under so it should be easy to unravel them. That&rsquo;s when I thought what Dave had said and it became extremely important that I finally look up what he was talking about. I totally learned how to properly roll a cable! I&rsquo;m pretty excited about it. Also, I love YouTube because without it I might have never figured it out 0_o.</p>
<p>The second big adventure that I had today was rescuing our neighbor from a particularly terrible situation. Stephanie and I drove home after seeing &ldquo;Warm Bodies,&rdquo; which was good by the way, and we saw our neighbor standing by her car. I had assumed that she just got home, but then she told us that she had been locked out of her apartment&hellip;by her dog! Her dog had managed to jump up on the door and lock the security lock. That&rsquo;s the lock that doesn&rsquo;t have a visible outside &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; mechanism. This was incredibly unfortunate since no lock smith could get it open, no key would work, and well&hellip;there&rsquo;s no way to open that door.</p>
<p>She ended up calling maintenance and they couldn&rsquo;t do anything but bring a ladder over so she could climb up on her porch, go in and then unlock it. That&rsquo;s when I come in. I helped the maintenance lady carry the super huge ladder over and get it set up. I was a little nervous about how their dogs would react, so our neighbor had volunteered to go up, but when the time came, she wasn&rsquo;t quite up to it. I just manned up and went up there like a BOSS. The dog ended up running right past me barking a lot. I just wandered to the front door, opened it up, and TADA! It was pretty awesome. I&rsquo;ve never climbed onto a back porch with a ladder but it was definitely fun enough. I like helping people out, especially when it comes to doing something that I don&rsquo;t normally get into :).</p>
<p>So today was a little bit more adventurous than a typical Sunday. I had a good time with it! I&rsquo;ve also had a good time playing on my new port-o-puter and setting it all up. I think it&rsquo;s ready for its first day at work tomorrow. We&rsquo;ll see how it all goes!</p>
