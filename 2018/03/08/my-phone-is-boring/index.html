            <p>I love my iPhone. I do. It&rsquo;s a thing that keeps me in touch with people, gives me cool stuff to look at when I&rsquo;m standing in line, or more likely sitting on the toilet. There is an endless array of neat things to download and keep me occupied during spurts where I have nothing better to do. The truth is, however, that I have tons of things I should be doing. The iPhone is just a hit of dopamine that makes me feel good.</p>
<p>I took steps a couple weeks ago to remove social media from my life. I&rsquo;ve been doing well without it, but I missed a critical detail regarding my phone: I still had tons of apps that kept me going to my phone. Even without social media apps, I was still finding ways to dive back into my phone and out of the real world. I decided to delete every app that I used that took me away from my moment. Any app that I could go to when I was idle had to go. The CNN app, Reddit, Instagram, all of it. I don&rsquo;t even have a news app on my phone anymore.</p>
<p><strong>My phone is boring and I am free.</strong></p>
<p>Because of my little experiment, I have finished a book that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get through for months. I have started another book and am most of the way through, I am playing with Sam instead of just being in the room with him while he plays, and I am seeking out more productive things to do with my time. All that time that I thought was just a few minutes I could steal and poke around on my phone is now being used for real growth. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I still open my phone and look at it, but everytime I do I&rsquo;m met with nothing. Nothing to click on and no notifications begging for me to open some app I don&rsquo;t need. You might think that I would be uninformed and a little lost on the happenings in the world. You would be right. I don&rsquo;t know the day to day goings on of our government or what Kim Kardashian is wearing today. I never cared about the latter, but the former matters. I instead take some time in the morning to read news on a real computer like our grandparents did with the paper. I read it like it&rsquo;s not a continuously updating stream of information. It&rsquo;s just a morning review and then I get on with my life.</p>
<p>I have been amazed at how my life has changed since I started doing this. It&rsquo;s not like some massive change in everything about me, but I&rsquo;m taking control of something in my world that has had me in its clutches, and I&rsquo;m proud of it. It was a problem, and I&rsquo;m so thankful to have recognized and done something about it.</p>
