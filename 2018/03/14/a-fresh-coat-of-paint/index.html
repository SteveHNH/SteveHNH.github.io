            <p>It’s time.</p>
<p>I finally moved this blog to some place that is a better example of who I am today than who I was in 2004 when I started it. It’s been a long journey and one that I look back on fondly if not with some cringing thanks to how dumb I was when I was just out of high school. I’ve dropped the site on a brand new domain, and renamed it. I’ll always have a special place in my heart for <strong>Bits and Binary</strong>, but there is so much more to me than just tech news and gadgets. I can’t really remember the last time that I obsessed over a random device that I thought I needed. I like to think that I’ve transcended that a bit and now look to more long lasting stuff.</p>
<p>I’ve titled this with just my name and a tagline that I think defines what I’m searching for and what this life really feels like it’s about. It’s not about getting anywhere in particular, but rather about what we do while we journey from age 0 to 100. There’s so much out there to get into and we definitely owe it to ourselves to try and improve as we go. Lately I’ve been reading a ton more and trying to be a better human being. Honestly, nothing makes you want to <em>do better</em> than having a child who watches your every move. You stop seeing yourself through your own eyes, and instead you start considering how everything you do reflect on your kid. At least that’s how it works for me, and I’d like to think it pushed me upwards and made me grow up.</p>
<p>Now, all that being said, I’m totally going to post about movies and video games here when it matters. When something is mind blowing and I just need to get it out of my system. Alongside that though, I’d like to post more about books I’m reading, lessons I’ve learned, and other things that might help others. Stephanie had a revelation the other day that “no one really changes” which we both had to laugh about. I was making some joke in the car that was utterly ridiculous and both of us were sent back in time to when we were teenagers for just a minute. Turns out the core of a person never really goes anywhere, we just keep stacking stuff on top of it. Hopefully it’s stuff of value that makes those fun aspects of who we are even more focused and worthwhile.</p>
<p>So here’s to a new era of the blog. More of the same, but better.</p>
