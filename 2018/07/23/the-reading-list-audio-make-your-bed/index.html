            <p>_The Reading List is a segment of the blog where I let you know the thing I just read and some thoughts about it along with the next book in my list. Should you want to read along with me, let me know in the comments!Â _</p>
<p>I am not worthy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I felt when I finished this one. I think at the end of his days, William McRaven will be able to say that he sucked the marrow out of life. This is a life well lived. Partly because of the things he accomplished, but mainly because he challenged himself to persevere and get through some of the most grueling events that life can throw at you. These were events that he <em>chose</em> to participate in. Of course, he&rsquo;s dealt with bad hands here and there, but he put himself through many of the stories that made it into this book.</p>
<p>McRaven is an inspiration to people everywhere. The lessons that he lays out in this book are things that everyone can use to arm themselves for the challenges they are going to face throughout their lives. These aren&rsquo;t just lessons that a Navy seal needs. These are lessons that we could all stand to hear, they just hear them louder and more intentional than we will. I have no idea where he got his strength and toughness, but it&rsquo;s on full display here.</p>
<p>I thought it would be a bit off-putting to begin with because I&rsquo;m not a military man, and I&rsquo;m generally averse to some of the voice he uses in this book. He comes across as an incredibly rigid and disciplined man, and I don&rsquo;t know why that kind of attitude bothers me. It&rsquo;s so impressive and something to honor for sure, but I have some little piece of me that fights it. I&rsquo;ve always been that way and I&rsquo;m not sure why. That being said, it&rsquo;s something I need to overcome. It&rsquo;s not a problem with him, but a problem with me.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I started making my bed in the morning as suggested as the first lesson in this book. Having not read the book, I didn&rsquo;t know the reasons behind it, but I knew it was somehow important to an incredibly successful person. It&rsquo;s honestly changed me. Not just the way my day starts, but also the way my day goes from the morning on. It&rsquo;s a simple, accomplishable task that you can do at the beginning of the day to get the ball rolling. If you can make your bed, you can make breakfast. If you can make your bed, you&rsquo;ve already gotten to work so getting to work is less of a slog.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this to pretty much everyone. I think there are sections of this book that resonate more than others for me, but it could be largely different for you. Give it a read and see if it can change you even a little bit. If anything, it shows the limits that a human being can be pushed to and continue moving forward. We all have it in us, we just need to do things that help prove to us that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
