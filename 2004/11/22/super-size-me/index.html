I know I&rsquo;m lovin' it! <a href="http://www.hello.com/"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbh.gif" alt="Posted by Hello">
</a></p>
<p>So Today made the 3rd time that I have seen Super Size Me, the movie about the guy who ate McDonald&rsquo;s for 30 days with nothing else, and I&rsquo;ve decided that I shouldn&rsquo;t eat McDonalds&hellip;or at least not as much as I currently do. I probably eat it at least 3 times a week and most of the time the order consists of either 2 cheeseburgers and fries, or 10 chicken nuggets and fries. So anyway, today was the big test. I left school starving as usual, but this time I said to myself (out loud mind you) &ldquo;Stephen, you canNOT eat McDonald&rsquo;s today, it&rsquo;s bad for you&rdquo;. After a few minutes of yelling at myself about how bad I eat, I finally decided not to go there&hellip;&hellip;then a few miles down the road I wished that I had. That hamburger would&rsquo;ve been so good this afternoon. Now this wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal, but I have a 45 minute drive home after school and that is a long way to go when you&rsquo;re hungry.
After my McDonald&rsquo;s dilemma, I also decided to restrict myself from another thing that brings me great happiness&hellip;..talking to<a href="http://landoman.blogspot.com"> lando </a>on my cellphone. I call him sometimes after school on my way home because it makes the time go by faster&hellip;.yeah and I like talking to him too (heh that was for you <a href="http://landoman.blogspot.com">lando</a>), but I went over on my cellphone minutes last month so I have to stop. Anyway, I ended up talking to him anyway, because I HAD to tell him about this  movie idea that I have and that I really want to make because I believe that it has tons of potential to being a really cool short film. I like making films, and I haven&rsquo;t made one in a long time. But he was playing Halo so I chose not to inform him on all the cool plot points and camera angles, which I&rsquo;m sure left him wondering what in the blue blazes I was talking about. Trust me, <a href="http://landoman.blogspot.com">Lando</a>, it&rsquo;s gonna be sweeeet.
Well thats about it for today I suppose. I bought the book The Fall of Reach based on Halo. I heard it was really good and so far I&rsquo;m liking it. Lots of military what-not and battles. I needed something to read other than the dozens of blogs that I enjoy now. Sometimes you just need some good fiction. But when I think of some of these blogs I&rsquo;ve read, I realize that real life is sometimes way more entertaining than fiction. Depends on whose life you are reading about. I&rsquo;m gonna start putting those special nuggets of joy that I find on my Super Cool Blogs links so you guys can check them out too. For some reason I hate taking up tons of space on anything, I choose to compact most everything, and this applies to more than just the internet and my ridiculously organized files on my computer. I guess I&rsquo;m just weird like that. You guys have a good one.</p>
<p>just saw the new Blink 182 video &ldquo;Always&rdquo;&hellip;.its all crazy like. I love it.</p>
